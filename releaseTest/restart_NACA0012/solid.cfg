% The start time is in this case complex to set. We need to consider the time at which we started coupling before restart t1
% Then we need to consider the start time before restart t2. The structural solution was then at t3 = (RESTART_ITER-1)*dT - t1 - t2
% We start immediately coupling with restart, thus, we must have that t3 + dT = RESTART_ITER*dT - RESTART_ITER*dt - TIME_START
% So TIME_START = - dT - (RESTART_ITER-1)*dT + t1 + t2 = - RESTART_ITER*dT + t1 + t2
