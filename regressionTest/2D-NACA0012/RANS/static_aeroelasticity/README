In this case, a very tight tolerance on the coupling must be used. Indeed, if the system is oscillating
during convergence, there will be a point (an extremum) where it is not moving much. In the unsteady computation
this will stop the FSI loop and we will switch to a next time step... in the steady computation we will stop
the computation completely -> we need tight tollerances

We do not care so much about the time step size. In the unsteady computation this is stringly related to the
vibration modes in the system. The usual stuff that we have to resolve, at least, double the most important
frequency. Both for nyquist and for the damping of the integrator. Here we only care about reaching the
convergence fast -> use big step


In this case we have the frequency at about 8Hz, let's make 10, so we would need 20 -> 50ms

The theoretical response is:
((0.5*1.225*(0.05*sqrt(1.4*287*293))^2*0.349388748)/205.4) = 0.3066
((0.5*1.225*(0.05*sqrt(1.4*287*293))^2*0.005629448)/2025) = 5.0115e-04
